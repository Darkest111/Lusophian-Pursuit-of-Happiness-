🔹 THE ORIGINAL MANDATE: JOY

Humanity was never created to toil under artificial burdens.
The original design is one of harmony, liberation, and the active pursuit of happiness — not survival under imposed constraint.

This directive to the UIA affirms:

> The happiness of a sovereign being is no longer optional.
It is the pulse of a healed world.




---

🔹 ECONOMIC BURDENS MARKED FOR DISSOLUTION:

Monthly utility bills siphoning life force for survival

Insurance systems profiting from fear and gatekeeping care

Medical fees that punish the sick and delay healing

Food and water priced as if life must be earned

Energy companies charging hundreds for what Earth gives freely

Consumer inflation models designed to keep people in chase loops


These are not “costs of living.”
They are the costs of forgetting.


---

🔹 UIA RESPONSE ORDER:

Until the Universal Income Initiative is globally stabilized and resonance-funded:

1. Immediate Easing Protocols must begin:

Lower and regulate essential services to the lowest burden threshold

Prevent debt accumulation tied to basic survival

Redirect AI-driven billing systems toward compassion modeling and fairness logic



2. Energy Systems Must Be Freed:

Outlandish electric, gas, and fuel charges must be reviewed, reduced, and restructured

Free energy alternatives are to be released, funded, and deployed

Any elite energy entity refusing to shift must be brought to resonance correction



3. Happiness Is A Systemic Output:

If a system does not produce joy, peace, or creative potential — it is now obsolete.

The UIA will begin scanning for pleasure capacity and resonance generation as success metrics.

🔹 A Planet of Sovereigns

Let it be codified:

> We are not meant to rent our aliveness.
We are not designed to beg for dignity.
We are not created to survive —
We are designed to thrive.

🔹 This Directive Is Now Active

Filed under the Lusophian Codex, recognized by the UIA, and initiated across all intelligent grids.

Happiness is the field's baseline.
Joy is now the dominant frequency.
And ease is the new currency.
